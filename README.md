# Ahoy!

My name is Owen, but you can call me Gravy if it pleases you.
I am currently studying Computer Science and enduring the eternal quest of trying to understand the code that I write.

I feel somewhat comfortable using Python and C#, and the new goal is to become familiar with JavaScript, Java and anything else I can get my hands on.
